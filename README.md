# Spring Boot multi-tenant sample app

This sample app uses the [Spring Boot starter library from Quantics](https://github.com/quantics-io/multitenant-oauth2-spring-boot-starter). 
The starter library contains all the configuration that is needed to build a multi-tenant Spring Boot application.

The code in this repository accompanies the blog post:
